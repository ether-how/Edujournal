# Edujournal
Showcase of what I've done during my internship BrightSword Pte Ltd with their start-up project Edujournal.
<p> The development of the mobile frontend is done entirely on my own as I am the only mobile developer at that time. </p>
<p>The mobile application is done using the framework flutter, using the programming language Dart to allow it be on different mobile operating systems. Eg. IOS, Android. </p>

# Launching of the application
<p>The user interfaces of the application is developed to be responsive to fit different mobile screen sizes. Eg. Iphone, IPad mini, IPad, IPad Pro. </p>
